The WooCommerce Product Add-Ons extension only works as the product level.  As such, if you add custom fields using the Product Add-Ons extension those fields will show up on every product variation you might be using.

This extension adds a checkbox to the variable product options so that you can show / hide the Product Add-Ons fields accordingly.
