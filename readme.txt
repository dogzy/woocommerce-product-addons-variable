Adds variable product compatibility to the WooCommerce Product Add-Ons extension.

== Description ==

= Introduction =

The WooCommerce Product Add-Ons extension only works as the product level.  As such, if you add custom fields using the Product Add-Ons extension those fields will show up on every product variation you might be using.

This extension adds a checkbox to the variable product options so that you can show / hide the Product Add-Ons fields accordingly.

= Get Involved =
Developers can contribute to the source code on the [WooCommerce Product Add-Ons Variable Git repository on GitHub](https://github.com/angelleye/woocommerce-product-addons-variable).

This plugin sets the default so that Product Add-on options are not displayed for variable products unless specifically enabled via a check-box at the product variation level.
